# Subscription Platform - Laravel API

This document provides instructions for setting up and testing the Laravel API for your subscription platform.

## Special Instructions for Local/Remote Setup

### 1. Environment Configuration

Ensure your `.env` file is correctly configured for both local and remote environments.

#### Database Setup:
Update the `.env` file with the correct database credentials for both local and remote databases.

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1  # Localhost or your remote DB host
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=subscription_platform
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

#### Queue Configuration:
For background processing (like email dispatching), ensure queues are set up. Use a `database` or `redis` driver for production instead of the default `sync` driver for local development.

```env
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
```

Run the queue migration:

```bash
php artisan queue:table
php artisan migrate
```

#### Mail Configuration:
Configure the mail settings in the `.env` file for sending email notifications.

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@example.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

### 2. Migrations and Seeders

Run migrations and seeders to set up your database with the necessary tables.

#### Run migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

(Optional) Run seeders if needed:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

### 3. Queues

Ensure your queue worker is running for background tasks (like email dispatching).

#### Start the queue worker:

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

Alternatively, schedule the queue to run continuously on remote production servers:

```bash
php artisan schedule:run
```

### 4. API Testing

#### Local Testing:
Use a tool like Postman to send API requests to `http://localhost:8000/api/` (ensure the server is running with `php artisan serve`).

#### Remote Testing:
Verify that the API routes are exposed correctly on your remote server. If you're using a reverse proxy like Nginx, ensure the API routes are routed to the correct Laravel application.

## Project Setup

### Local Development:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/subscription-platform.git
cd subscription-platform
```

2. Set up the `.env` file:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure the database and mail settings.

3. Run migrations to set up the database:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

(Optional) Run the seeder if needed:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

4. Start the Laravel development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

5. Start the queue worker (for background email dispatching):

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

6. Use Postman to test the available API endpoints at `http://localhost:8000/api/`.
